# Spotify-Data-Analysis

The goal is to better understand what makes music popular as well as the audio features that make up specific genres.
This dataset consists of data on 52,000 songs that were randomly picked from a variety of genres sorted in alphabetic order (a as in “acoustic” to h as in “hiphop”). 
For the purposes of this analysis, you can assume that the data for one song are independent for data from other songs.
